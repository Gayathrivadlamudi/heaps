# heaps
Heaps are type of binary trees but we implement these with Arrays or ArrayList and not Nodes because of Time Complexity.There are two types of heaps 
1]MAX_HEAP:Here the Parent Node >= Child Nodes
2]MIN_HEAP:Here the Parent Node<= Child Nodes
Time complexity of:
    Adding a element-O(logn)
    removing a element-O(logn)
by using heaps it helps
